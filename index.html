                    What oral & maxillofacial surgery is, and what does it entail
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Oral & maxillofacial surgery is a surgical specialty that focuses on diagnosing and treating diseases, injuries, and defects of the mouth, teeth, jaws, and face. It is a branch of dentistry that deals with the correction of these conditions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The most common type of oral & maxillofacial surgery is wisdom tooth removal. Other standard procedures include the correction of cleft lip and palate, the treatment of TMJ disorders, and the extraction of impacted teeth. Oral & maxillofacial surgeons also frequently treat facial trauma and perform cosmetic surgery on the face, head, and neck. The surgeon will then evaluate your case and develop a treatment plan.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Oral & maxillofacial surgery is a safe and effective way to treat many conditions of the mouth, teeth, jaws, and face. However, as with any surgery, there are risks involved. These risks will be discussed with you by your surgeon before your procedure. If you have any questions about oral & maxillofacial surgery, please speak to your dentist or oral & maxillofacial surgeon. They will be able to provide you with more information and answer any questions that you may have.

                    How to prepare for oral & maxillofacial surgery
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It’s essential to clearly understand what oral & maxillofacial surgery is and what it involves before undergoing the procedure. Here are some things you need to know:
                </p>
                <p>
                    Oral & maxillofacial surgery is a branch of medicine that deals with diagnosing and treating diseases, injuries, and deformities of the mouth, jaws, and face.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The scope of oral & maxillofacial surgery includes dental implants, wisdom teeth removal, corrective jaw surgery, treatment for TMJ disorders, and more.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Oral & maxillofacial surgeons are specially trained to perform these procedures.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most oral & maxillofacial surgery procedures are performed on an outpatient basis, so you won’t have to stay in the hospital overnight.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, some procedures may require a short hospital stay. Before your surgery, your oral & maxillofacial surgeon will give you specific instructions on preparing for your system. You must follow these instructions carefully to reduce your risk of complications.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some general things to keep in mind when preparing for oral & maxillofacial surgery include:
                </p>
                <ul style="padding-left: 30px;">
                    <li>
                        Quitting smoking at least two weeks before your surgery. Smoking increases the risk of complications after surgery.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Avoid drinking alcohol for at least 24 hours before your surgery. Alcohol can increase bleeding during surgery.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Eating a healthy diet and staying hydrated. It will help you recover more quickly after surgery.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Arranging for someone to drive you home after your surgery. You will not be able to drive home after most oral & maxillofacial surgery procedures.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                    What to expect during and after oral & maxillofacial surgery.
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When you come in for oral & maxillofacial surgery, the first thing we will do is numb the area with a local anesthetic. This numbing medication will make sure you are comfortable during the procedure. You may also be given sedation medication to help you relax.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once you are numb and comfortable, the surgeon will make an incision in the gum tissue to expose the bone. The surgeon will then remove any necessary bone and tissue. Sometimes, the surgeon may need to place plates or screws to hold the bones in place while they heal. After the procedure is complete, the incisions will be closed with sutures (stitches). You will be given instructions on how to care for your mouth and incisions at home. It is essential to follow these instructions carefully to ensure proper healing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most people experience some discomfort and swelling after oral & maxillofacial surgery. This is normal and will usually resolve within a few days. Pain medication can help manage any discomfort you may experience.

                    Certain risks are associated with any surgery, and oral & maxillofacial surgery is no different.

In rare cases, patients may also experience problems with their teeth or jawbone following surgery.
